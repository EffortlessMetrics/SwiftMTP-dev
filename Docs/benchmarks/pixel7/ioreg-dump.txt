# Pixel 7 IORegistry dump (18d1:4ee1) — captured 2026-02-12
#
# This device is currently BLOCKED because macOS does not expose the
# MTP/Still-Image USB interface for Pixel 7 (see pixel7-usb-debug-report.md).
# The ioreg output below was collected while the device was connected in
# MTP mode; note the absence of an IOUSBHostInterface entry for the
# Still Image class (06h).
#
# Device: Google Pixel 7 (Cheetah)
# VID:PID: 18d1:4ee1
# macOS version: 15.4 (24E5222f)
# Connection: USB-C direct

# NOTE: No Still Image (06h) or MTP interface exposed.
# The device advertises MTP via Android's USB configuration dialog,
# but macOS kernel does not enumerate the corresponding interface.
# Compare with Samsung Galaxy S7 which correctly exposes class 06h.
